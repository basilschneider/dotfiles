This file is useless. But I keep it in my dotfiles for the following reason: Git
cannot add folders, but only files. I don't want any files in the folder
~/.vim/temp/undo to be added. But if I don't add any files, ~/.vim/temp/undo is
not created on a system where I clone my dotfiles. That means that the undo
function does not work, until I create ~/.vim/temp/undo. Since I don't like
doing things by hand, I add this file.
