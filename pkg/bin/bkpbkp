# Make backup of backup
# Why? If you delete file ~/foo and make a backup, it will also be deleted on
# the backup. While recovering it is not impossible, it is at least tedious. If
# you make a backup of the backup (bkpbkp), ~/foo is still available, assuming
# a) ~/foo existed when you created the last bkpbkp
# b) you meanwhile did not run bkpbkp again
# From a) it follows, that you should run bkpbkp as often as possible.
# From b) it follows, that you should run bkpbkp as little as possible.
# Running bkpbkp maybe every other month should be reasonable

# Figure out if you are in local network or not. This is needed since router
# does not support NAT Hairpinning
