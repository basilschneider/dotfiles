# Send commands to all panes of a certain tmux session

# TODO: You should check if you have vim open in the sessions. If you send a
#       command to all tmux panes, then it will be interpreted as bash command,
#       which is what you probably intended to do, but in vim it will be
#       intrepreted as command in vim, and do some random stuff. You can always
#       go back to the window and undo things in vim, so it does not necessarily
#       wreak havoc, but it can lead to undesired behavior, a) by messing up
#       the document you have opened in vim, and b) by *not* invoking the
#       command in bash.
